ECO-TREE Advisor: Intelligent Tree Growth Prediction Model

The ECO-TREE Advisor is a machine learning-based model developed to assist in selecting suitable tree species for plantation based on various environmental factors such as soil type, water availability, and climate conditions.

This innovative project aims to address critical societal issues like deforestation, urban greenery enhancement, and overall environmental sustainability by optimizing tree planting strategies tailored to specific environmental contexts.
